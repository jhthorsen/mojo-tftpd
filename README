DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a server for the Trivial File Transfer Protocol
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol>.

    From Wikipedia:

        Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a file transfer protocol notable
        for its simplicity. It is generally used for automated transfer of
        configuration or boot files between machines in a local environment.

    The connection ($c) which is referred to in this document is an instance
    of Mojo::TFTPd::Connection.

EVENTS
  error
        $self->on(error => sub {
            my($self, $str) = @_;
        });

    This event is emitted when something goes wrong: Fail to "listen" to
    socket, read from socket or other internal errors.

  finish
        $self->on(finish => sub {
            my($self, $c, $error) = @_;
        });

    This event is emitted when the client finish, either successfully or due
    to an error. $error will be an empty string on success.

  rrq
        $self->on(rrq => sub {
            my($self, $c) = @_;
        });

    This event is emitted when a new read request arrives from a client. The
    callback should set "filehandle" in Mojo::TFTPd::Connection or the
    connection will be dropped. "filehandle" in Mojo::TFTPd::Connection can
    also be a Mojo::Asset reference.

  wrq
        $self->on(wrq => sub {
            my($self, $c) = @_;
        });

    This event is emitted when a new write request arrives from a client.
    The callback should set "filehandle" in Mojo::TFTPd::Connection or the
    connection will be dropped. "filehandle" in Mojo::TFTPd::Connection can
    also be a Mojo::Asset reference.

ATTRIBUTES
  connection_class
      $str = $self->connection_class;
      $self = $self->connection_class($str);

    Used to set a custom connection class. Defaults to
    Mojo::TFTPd::Connection.

  ioloop
    Holds an instance of Mojo::IOLoop.

  listen
        $str = $self->server;
        $self->server("127.0.0.1:69");
        $self->server("tftp://*:69"); # any interface

    The bind address for this server.

  max_connections
    How many concurrent connections this server can handle. Default to 1000.

  retries
    How many times the server should try to send ACK or DATA to the client
    before dropping the connection.

  inactive_timeout
    How long a connection can stay idle before being dropped. Default is 15
    seconds.

  retransmit
    How many times the server should try to retransmit the last packet on
    timeout before dropping the connection. Default is 0 (disable
    retransmits)

  retransmit_timeout
    How long a connection can stay idle before last packet being
    retransmitted. Default is 2 seconds.

METHODS
  start
    Starts listening to the address and port set in "Listen". The "error"
    event will be emitted if the server fail to start.
